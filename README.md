Food Image Classification using CNN
This project presents a deep learning approach for classifying food images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to accurately identify various types of food from images, making it useful for applications like restaurant menu scanning, diet tracking apps, or food recognition APIs.

📁 Project Structure
CNN_network(food_image_classification).ipynb — Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.

🧠 Model Overview
Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for feature extraction and image classification.

Built using Keras with a TensorFlow backend.

Includes image preprocessing such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation for improving model generalization.

Trained on a labeled food image dataset with multiple classes.

📊 Features
